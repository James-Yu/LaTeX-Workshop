<!--
Disable all the other extensions except for LaTeX Workshop, restart VS Code, and check that you still see this issue. 
-->

- [ ] I see this issue when only this extension is running.

<!-- 
Visit the [wiki FAQ](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/FAQ) and check whether your issue is already referenced there before filling an issue.
-->

- [ ] I visited the wiki/FAQ.

<!--
If your issue is with compiling a document (for example into a pdf file - not having to do with finding the root file of a project), 
check first that you can compile manually. This can be done by entering the compile/build command into a terminal.
-->

- [ ] I can compile the TeX document manually without the issue.
