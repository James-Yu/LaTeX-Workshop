# Overview

`snippetpanel.json` is generated by `dev/createSymbolSvgs.ts`. The file includes all the SVG texts to display on the snippet view. It is loaded by the WebView View with `fetch`.

The content of the tab of `TikZ`, including SVG texts, is directly written on the HTML file.

## PDF.js

We load PDF.js inside the WebView of the Snippet View to render the thumbnails of PDF files for hovers.
