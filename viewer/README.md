### Overview

The pdf viewer is based on [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) by Mozilla Foundation. Files are from the [prebuilt download version](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/getting_started/#download). The reason we do not use `web/pdf_viewer.js` from `pdfjs-dist` package is that `pdf_viewer.js` does not provide features we need. `pdf_viewer.js` is much simpler than `viewer.js`. See [link](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/9318).

We load `viewer.html` in `iframe` in [Webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) of VS Code through a local Web server, which enables us to load the same `viewer.html` on the browser in a separate window through the same local server.
We control the PDF viewers on both the tab and the browser through WebSockets.

We provide additional features by setting up new event listeners in `latexworkshop.js` for DOM objects in `viewer.html`. We do not and should not override functions defined by PDF.js.

We can see the changes, [diff1](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/commit/ff39f772296a444c2ddc57e93f3a9928fd0c9030#diff-ff661e0ff756ae1ff026c0e8f4561d0e), [diff2](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/commit/128c9826cda64f7cdcae33490ddec2dc64aafb31#diff-ff661e0ff756ae1ff026c0e8f4561d0e), and [diff3](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/commit/1b1b58a2fe8ed33a2e7fa765b78f6ea1614f217b),  we have made to `viewer.js`. We had better find a way to achieve this without modifying `viewer.js`.

JavaScript files, `latexworkshop.js`, and others, are generated in `../out/viewer/` from TypeScript files.

#### Misc

Mozilla [asks](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/getting_started/) web developers to reskin `viewer.html` because Firefox users would think bugs of the viewer on the web site are ones of Firefox and would report them to the PDF.js team. See [link](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/5609). Our usage does not cause such a problem.

### PDFWorker

By default, PDFWorker is recreated every time reopening a PDF file. By setting `workerPort`,
we can reuse the PDFWorker:
``` javascript
  workerPort: {
    value: new Worker('/build/pdf.worker.js'),
    kind: OptionKind.WORKER
  },
```
See [mozilla/pdf.js/pull/8107](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/8107) for the details of the setting.
